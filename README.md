# Car Airplane Image Classifier

# Project Description
This GitHub project focuses on image classification of airplanes and cars. Using deep learning techniques with Keras, we have developed a model that can accurately distinguish between images of airplanes and cars. The project aims to provide a practical solution for automated object recognition in real-world scenarios. By leveraging convolutional neural networks, our model achieves high accuracy in classifying these two distinct classes. Join us in exploring the fascinating field of computer vision and contribute to the advancement of image classification algorithms.
